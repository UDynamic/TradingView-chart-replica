# TradingView-chart-replica
This project is a fully dynamic and interactive candlestick chart built with D3.js, designed to replicate the look and functionality of TradingView. The chart supports real-time updates, zooming, panning, and smooth animations while maintaining a constant number of visible candlesticks (30) that dynamically adapt to the zoom level.
