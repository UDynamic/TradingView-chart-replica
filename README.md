# 📈 Dynamic TradingView-Style Candlestick Chart with D3.js



## 📝 Overview
This project is a **fully interactive candlestick chart** built with **D3.js**, designed to mimic the behavior of **TradingView charts**. It features **real-time updates**, **smooth animations**, and a **dynamic zooming experience**, making it an ideal starting point for anyone interested in **financial data visualization**.

The chart generates **random market data**, ensuring **open-close consistency**, and dynamically **adapts the x-axis time range** based on zoom level. The number of candles displayed **remains fixed at 30**, but zooming reveals more granular timeframes (e.g., from 4-hour candles down to 1-minute candles).
